## Notes
This work is based a 'saved through the browser' and broken version which is available in Williammer's repository [here](https://github.com/Williammer/Shodo).   

Some smaller changes have been made in order to bring back the application into a working condition (mostly due to not providing online storage for saving calligraphy drawn by users, and to missing files - a very few I managed to grab through web.archive.org).

The goal of this project was to kill time (my ISP went down over the weekend), and get to play with JS.

Not sure how much time I will spend on maintaining this (since it's mostly just a novelty), but would like to implement an 'undo' feature (the code base already has fragments of it), generating an animated clip with the strokes, and maybe a share on social media feature.
